## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
centers <- st_read("health-centers.geojson")
bikes <- st_read("bike-stations.json")
housing <-st_read("housing-areas.geojson")
cafes <- st_read("cafes.geojson")
pops <- st_read("pops.geojson")
```
```{r}
centers_plot <- ggplot(centers) +
  geom_sf()

```{r}
ggplot(bikes) +
  geom_sf(shape = 11, color = "blue", size = 0.5, alpha = 0.1)
